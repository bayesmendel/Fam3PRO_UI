Column,Description
PedigreeID,"An alpha-numeric value; ID for each pedigree. There should not be any families with the same PedigreeID. This value must be fully anonymized and may not be a Medical Record Number (MRN). This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
ID,A numeric value; ID for each individual. There should not be any duplicated entries within the same pedigree.
name,"A character string which is a unique description of the relative's relationship to the proband, ie ""Proband"", ""Sister 1"", ""Mat. Grandmother"". This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
side,"a one letter character string that indicates whether the relative is on the materal or pateral side of the proband's family. Expected values are ""m"" = maternal side, ""p"" = paternal side, and NA for not applicable. This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
relationship,"A character string, which is non-unique within the pedigree, that describes how the relative is related to the proband. Similar to ""name"" except it does not enumerate relationships of the same type (2 sisters are not labelled as sister 1 and sister 2) or include Mat. or Pat. prefixed that indicate materal or paternal side of the family (ie materal and paternal grandmothers are just listed a grandmother). This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
Twins,"A numeric value; 0 for non-identical/single births, 1 for the first set of identical twins/multiple births in the family, 2 for the second set, etc. Missing entries are assumed to be 0."
Sex,A numeric value; 0 for female and 1 for male. Missing entries are not currently supported.
MotherID,A numeric value; unique ID for someone’s mother.
FatherID,A numeric value; unique ID for someone’s father.
isProband,"A numeric value; 1 if someone is a proband, 0 otherwise. This will be overridden by the proband argument in PanelPRO, if it is specified. At least one proband should be specified by either the isProband column or proband. Multiple probands are supported in PanelPRO but, PPI currently only supports pedigrees with one proband."
CurAge,"A numeric value; the age of censoring (current age if the person is alive or age of death if the person is dead). Ages ranging from 1 to 94 are allowed in PanelPRO but, are limited to 1 to 89 in PPI due to PPI""s data privacy policy. "
isDead,"A numeric value; 1 if someone is dead, 0 otherwise. Missing entries are assumed to be 0."
race,"A character string; expected values are ""All_Races"", ""AIAN"" (American Indian and Alaska Native), ""Asian"", ""Black"", ""White"", ""Hispanic"", ""WH"" (white Hispanic), and ""WNH"" (non-white Hispanic) (see PanelPRO:::RACE_TYPES). Asian-Pacific Islanders should be encoded as ""Asian"". Race information will be used to select the cancer and death by other causes penetrances used in the model. Missing entries are recoded as the unknown.race argument, which defaults to PanelPRO:::UNKNOWN_RACE. This column is the race category utilized by the PanelPRO model is coded based on a combination of ""NPPrace"" and ""NPPeth""."
Ancestry,"A character string; expected values are ""AJ"", ""nonAJ"", and ""Italian"" (see PanelPRO:::ANCESTRY_TYPES). Ancestry information will be used to select the allele frequencies used in the model. Missing entries are recoded as the unknown.ancestry argument, which defaults to PanelPRO:::UNKNOWN_ANCESTRY. This column is the ancestry category utilized by the PanelPRO model is coded based on a combination of ""NPPAJ"" and ""NPPIt""."
NPPrace,"A character string; expected values are ""All_Races"", ""AIAN"" (American Indian and Alaska Native), ""Asian"" (includes Pacific Islanders), ""Black"", and ""White"". This is a non-PanelPRO race category which is similar to the ""race"" column however, ""race"" combines traditional race categories with Hispanic ethnicity while ""NPPrace"" does not. This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
NPPeth,"A character string; expected values are ""Other_Ethnicity"", ""Hispanic"", and ""Non-Hispanic"". This indicates a relative's Hispanic ethnicity.  This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
NPPAJ,"A numeric value; 1 if Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, and 0 otherwise. This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
NPPIt,"A numeric value; 1 if Italian ancestry, and 0 otherwise. This column is required for using PPI but, is not required for PanelPRO."
riskmodX,"Where ""X"" is one of ""Mast"", ""Hyst"", ""Oopy"" which are abbreviations for the prophylactic surgeries: Mastectomy, Hysterectomy, or Oophorectomy, respectively. Expected values are: 0 if surgery did not occur and 1 if it did. Note that mastectomies and oophorectomies must be bilateral to be considered prophylactic. "
interAgeX,"A numeric value indicating the age of ""riskmodX"".  Ages ranging from 1 to 94 are allowed in PanelPRO but, are limited to 1 to 89 in PPI due to PPI's data privacy policy. The value is NA if the surgery never occurred or if it did occur but, the age is unknown."
ER,"A tumor marker associated with breast cancer that will modify the likelihood of phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Positive results should be coded as 1, negative results should be coded as 0, and unknown results should be coded as NA."
PR,"A tumor marker associated with breast cancer that will modify the likelihood of phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Positive results should be coded as 1, negative results should be coded as 0, and unknown results should be coded as NA."
CK14,"A tumor marker associated with breast cancer that will modify the likelihood of phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Positive results should be coded as 1, negative results should be coded as 0, and unknown results should be coded as NA."
CK5.6,"A tumor marker associated with breast cancer that will modify the likelihood of phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Positive results should be coded as 1, negative results should be coded as 0, and unknown results should be coded as NA."
HER2,"A tumor marker associated with breast cancer that will modify the likelihood of phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Positive results should be coded as 1, negative results should be coded as 0, and unknown results should be coded as NA."
MSI,"A tumor marker associated with colorectal cancer that will modify the likelihood of phenotypes associated with MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Positive results should be coded as 1, negative results should be coded as 0, and unknown results should be coded as NA."
isAffX,"A numeric value; the affection status of cancer X, where X is a short cancer code for one of the PanelPRO cancers (see panelpro-cancers-abbreviations.csv or, in R, as.data.frame(PanelPRO:::CANCER_NAME_MAP)). Information for non-PanelPRO cancers are stored in the ""cancersJSON"" column. Affection status should be encoded as 1 if the individual was diagnosed, and 0 otherwise. Missing entries are not currently supported."
AgeX,"A numeric value; the age of diagnosis for cancer X, where X is a short cancer code for one of the PanelPRO cancers (see panelpro-cancers-abbreviations.csv or, in R, as.data.frame(PanelPRO:::CANCER_NAME_MAP)). Information for non-PanelPRO cancers are stored in the ""cancersJSON"" column. Ages ranging from 1 to 94 are allowed in PanelPRO but, are limited to 1 to 89 in PPI due to PPI""s data privacy policy. If the individual was not diagnosed for a given cancer or if the diagnosis age is unknown, their affection age should be encoded as NA and will be ignored otherwise."
cancersJSON,"A JSON string which contains a complete cancer history for the relative that includes PanelPRO and non-Panel cancer diagnoses and ages of diagnoses. This string can be converted into a R data frame using the jsonlite::fromJSON() function with the ""simplifyDataFrame"" arguement set to ""TRUE""."
FirstBCType,"Breast cancer type of the first primary breast cancer. The only options are ""Invasive"" for pure invasive and ""Invasive_DCIS"" for mixed invasive and DCIS. There is no option for pure DCIS because PanelPRO only considers invasive breast cancers. Use NA if no first primary breast cancer or unknown type."
AntiEstrogen,"Anti-estrogen therapy used to treat first primary breast cancer. The options are 0 for no, 1 for yes, and NA for unknown or for those never diagnosed with breast cancer."
HRPreneoplasia,"History of high risk preneoplasia (ie atypical hyperplasia or LCIS). The options are 0 for no, 1 for yes, and NA for unknown or for those never diagnosed with breast cancer."
BreastDensity,"BI-RADS breast density descriptor. The options are the letters a through d. a = almost entirely fatty, b = scattered areas of fibroglandular density, c = heterogeneously dense, and d = extremely dense. If the breast density is unknown, use NA."
FirstBCTumorSize,"Size category of the first primary breast cancer tumor. The only options are ""T0/T1/T2"", ""T3/T4"", ""Tis"". Use NA for unknown tumor size or if there was no first primary breast cancer."
PanelPRO gene columns,"Each PanelPRO gene (see either panelpro-gene-list.csv or, in R, PanelPRO:::GENE_TYPES) has its own column which indicates where the gene was tested and what the result was. Expected values are NA for not tested, 0 for tested but not P/LP, and 1 for tested and found to be P/LP. Note the column ""genesJSON"" contains all panel and gene result details for both PanelPRO and non-PanelPRO genes."
panelNames,"A character string containing the names of the germline genetic testing panels the relative was tested for. If tested for multiple panels, the panel names are separated by a comma."
genesJSON,"A JSON string which contains all panel and gene information for the relative that includes PanelPRO and non-Panel genes by panel name, gene, result type (P/LP, VUS, B/LB, or negative), nucleotide information, protein information, and zygosity. This string can be converted into a R data frame using the jsonlite::fromJSON() function with the ""simplifyDataFrame"" arguement set to ""TRUE""."

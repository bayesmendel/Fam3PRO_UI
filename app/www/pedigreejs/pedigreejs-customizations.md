# Modification Made to the PedigreeJS Code

The interactive pedigree tree used in the pedigree creator/editor of PPI utilizes a code base from [pedigreejs](https://ccge-boadicea.github.io/pedigreejs/) which has a GPLv3 license. The following are a list of changes made to the pedigreejs.v2.1.0-r9.js to customize it for PPI:

- The undo, redo, and refresh buttons were removed due to incompatibility.
- The icon for the fullscreen button was changed from fa-arrows-alt to fa-arrows due to conflicts with fontawesome and shiny.
